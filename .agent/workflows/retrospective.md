description: Generate a retrospective log.
---
1. Analyze the recent coding session and the `dev_log.md` if available.
2. Create a new file in `[app-name]/docs/retrospectives/` (e.g., `retrospective-[date].md` or `00X-title.md`).
3. Fill the file with:
   - **Summary**: Brief overview of work.
   - **What Went Well**: Successes.
   - **What Went Wrong**: Issues, bugs, or process failures.
   - **Lessons Learned**: Actionable improvements for next time.
4. Commit and push the retrospective to the current branch.
