1. Read the latest `retrospective.md` or `feedback.md`.
2. Identify specific, actionable rules that can prevent the recorded issues.
3. Edit `AGENTS.md` to include these new rules or refine existing ones.
    - *Tip*: Be specific (e.g., instead of "Testing is important", say "Save screenshots to docs/evidence").
4. Commit the changes to `AGENTS.md` with a descriptive message.
5. Notify the user of the rule update.
