description: Solicit feedback from the user.
---
1. Ask the user specific questions about the recent session:
   - "How was the quality of the code?"
   - "Did the process flow work for you?"
   - "Were there any misunderstandings or oversights?"
2. Wait for the user's response.
3. Save the feedback into a file `[app-name]/docs/feedback/feedback-[date].md` (create directory if needed).
4. Analyze the feedback for potential improvements to `AGENTS.md`.
