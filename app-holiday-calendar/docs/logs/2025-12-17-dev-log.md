## Holiday Calendar Implementation

### Activities
- Initialized `app-holiday-calendar` using Vite + React.
- Configured styling system with specific CSS variables for a premium look (Dark mode/Slate theme).
- Implemented `api.js` to fetch US holidays from `date.nager.at`.
- Created `MonthView` and `Calendar` components with `date-fns` logic.
- Implemented responsiveness and `HolidayCard` (as Tooltip).
- Verified application functionality via local dev server.
- Captured evidence of successful load.

### Technical Decisions
- Used `date-fns` for robust date math.
- Kept styles modular but centralized global variables.
- Handled API errors gracefully in `App.jsx`.

### Outcome
- App is running on port 5173.
- Screenshot saved to `docs/evidence`.
